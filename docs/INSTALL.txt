## Pre-Install
(*nix based systems)

Requires PHP >= 8.0

Install php and required modules:

    # and the suggested packages
    apt install php-cli php-json

For shell scripts: /bin/dash was the default shell (e.g. some helper scripts).
Some output may be different when using bash. ash seems to be fine.


### Windows

Please use cygwin (http://cygwin.com). Native support will be in the future)


### Quick install 
(*nix based systems)

    (copy & past but replace ##VERSIONSTRING## with e.g: 1.4.1)
    cd /tmp
    wget https://github.com/Multirename/multirename/blob/stable/deploy/multirename\
    -##VERSIONSTRING##.tgz?raw=true -O multirename-##VERSIONSTRING##.tgz
    tar -xf multirename-##VERSIONSTRING##.tgz
    chmod +x multirename.phar
    mv multirename.phar /usr/local/bin/multirename
    multirename --help

If a `multirename.phar` file is not available you can use one of the scripts in
`./src` or you can build your own phar file using `./build/make.php`.
Read more below.


    
## Developer install
    
Checkout the code and required library:

    git clone -b stable https://github.com/Multirename/multirename.git
    cd multirename/
    # checkout and update dependencies depending on the selected, cloned branch
    sh ./helper/gitupdate.sh [stable|testing|unstable]
    

The files you will call directly (if not already done):

    chmod +x <file>


## The program comes in two flavors

    1) Standard php usage (the src directory must be/stay intact):

    2) Single file usage (using a *.jar like file which is called "phar")
        (you can delete all other files. Everything is in that file)


    1. Possible options to run:

    1.1: php /PATH/multirename/src/multirename.php [--help|options]
    1.2: /PATH/multirename/src/multirename [--help|options]

    1.3: Make it global available:
        Become root
        `ln -s /PATH/multirename/src/multirename /usr/local/bin/`
        `multirename [--help|options]`


    2. For users who just want to use the program. Possible options:

    2.1: If available (served with the package):
         /PATH/multirename/build/multirename.phar [--help|options]

    2.2: Make it global available:
        copy or move /PATH/multirename/build/multirename.phar to /usr/local/bin/multirename
        multirename [--help|options]

        Or (but build directory must be intact):
        ln -s /PATH/multirename/build/multirename.phar /usr/local/bin/multirename
        multirename [--help|options]


    3.0: The library itself contains a `/bin/multirename.php` shell script 
        excluding all the rest of docs and other informations of this package.



# Build
(build/make.php)

This is not a typical make but for most of you probably an interesting corner.

This shows you how to create your own multirename.phar file or building a new 
release.


## Build options

1. php make.php install
2. php make.php clean
3. php make.php deploy


### 1.: php make.php install:

You decided to use the bundled version (all files and required libraries in
one file) for an easy usage. Use the file multirename.phar, thats all!
Older releases can work with older versions of php, from now on php8.0 or higher
is required.

If you want to build it by yourself, run: php make.php install

Note: This requires php >= 8.0 and changes in your php.ini of the used php 
version (if several on board). Changes in the php.ini for the cli only is ok. 
The php.ini for web/ live enviroment: STOP: NOT OK!

    e.g.: /etc/php/cli/php.ini; Change:
    ";phar.readonly = On" to
    "phar.readonly = 0" (drop semicolon, On to 0 (Off))

Then you are able to create your own multirename.phar file whichs bundles
all nessasary files for the program to one file (Like java *.jar files) and
you can use that file which is more easy to handle.

If you dont see any errors, the "multirename.phar" were created.
Please check if its working by running:

    php multirename.phar --help

The first line must show: "[INFO] Usage:"

The performance of this bundle is nearly the same than using the standard
sources for a php application (some people say it boost the performance...)
Well :-) less disk IO can make sence.

On upgrades only "multirename.phar" needs to be updated. Checkout the deploy/
directory where i may add final versions.


### 2.: php make.php clean:

Drops files created within the make script


### 3.: php make.php deploy

Task for a new release of multirename or just updating the documentation. For
