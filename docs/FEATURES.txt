# Features

-   Simple replacements or removes.
    Look for a sign and replace it with another one. E.g.: Change all spaces in
    filenames with an underscore (_).

-   Replacements using pcre engine (Perl compatible regular expressions).
    Regular expressions are patterns detection. With filenames it can help to
    split complex names to rebuild the filename you need. E.g.:
        
        "2015-01-01-20.00.00 The daily news.mpg"
        will become
        "daily_news_-_2015-01-01.mpg"

-   Find relevant files or directorys by a list of search keywords or regular 
    expressions.

-   Renaming including the path or breadcrumbs of the path the file belongs to.
    The path or the parts of it are always available to be used for the
    replacement.

-   Replacements including regular expressions and including path replacements
    in a regular exression. E.g.: /(%path2%)?(.*)?(\d{5})?/i
    Checkout the examples for more.

-   Creation of hard links or symlinks, relative or absolut instead of renaming
    the files. Including relocating in this case. "this" goes "../in/here/that"

-   Possibility to undo an action. < version 1.3.3
-   Possibility to undo multiple or seletced actions from history > version 2.*

-   A test mode to check the results when starting a rename process.

-   Presets: Possibility to save/update/delete a configuration. E.g. for a later 
    usage or batch processing like cron, at, batch...

-   Scan for matches in a recusivly way or just files in the given directory.

-   Scan for matches including search function also able to use regular expr.

-   Excluding matches you dont want to rename

-   Scan for all files or a given list of file extensions. E.g.: doc;docx;xls

-   Using external scripts as plugins to assist the renaming befor or after the 
    internal renaming performs. E.g. loading a new name from a text file.

-   More features to come. Some are already in the code marked as TODO.
